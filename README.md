## Queue-Fair Android Adapter README & Installation Guide

Queue-Fair can be added to any Android app easily in minutes.  This Queue-Fair Android module is suitable for native Android apps - if your Android app is a Web App running entirely in a browser, then the Client Side JavaScript Adapter is more suited to that.  You will need a Queue-Fair account - please visit https://queue-fair.com/free-trial if you don't already have one.  You should also have received our Technical Guide.  You can find out all about Queue-Fair at https://queue-fair.com


## About the Adapter
The Android Adapter has two major components, the Adapter code that checks and validates your users with the Queue-Fair service, which is similar to our Java Server-Side Adapter, and a Queue-Fair Activity that displays Queue, Hold, PreSale and PostSale display to your users when they cannot be Passed immediately by SafeGuard.

These pages are displayed inside a WebView.  You can create app-specific displays by using the Portal and a named Variant for your app.

All components are encapsulated into QueueFairClient, which is the class you will use to interact with Queue-Fair.

The Adapter manages its own persistent storage to remember that particular users have been Passed by Queue-Fair, in the form of SharedPreferences, and also persistent Cookies when a QueueFairActivity is launched.

Typically, you will replace a call to launch a protected activity or start a protected operation with a call to QueueFairClient, implementing a QueueFairListener object that then launches the protected activity or starts the operation when the app user is Passed by the queue.  

This distribution also includes source code for a demonstration app, QueueFairDemo.  Example code for using QueueFairClient is contained within the QueueFairDemo's MainActivity.java file.

If your vistors navigate away from a displayed Queue Page (by using the back button, by opening another app, or their phone going to sleep, for example), they do not lose their place in the queue - it is saved in the same way as places are saved for your web visitors.

This guide assumes you already have Android Studio.  We recommend you perform the steps below to build the QueueFairDemo app, before importing the QueueFairAdapter module into your existing Android app.

## Building the Demo App ##

**1.** Open Android Studio.  From the File menu, select New Project

**2.** Create a new Phone & Tablet app with an Empty Activity.  Make the package name "com.example.queuefairdemo".  The SDK version can be 16 or above.

**3.** Build and run your empty app with the Play button to make sure it's working.

**4.** In File Explorer or Finder (Not Android Studio), Copy-and-paste QueueFairDemo/app/src from this distribution into the "app" folder that has been created by Studio, overwriting any files therein.  If your resulting app/src/main/java/com/examp/queuefairdemo folder has a MainActivity.kt file left over from making the empty activity, delete it.

**5.** Android Studio will recognise the changes.  You will have build errors until you add the Adapter module as detailed in the next section.

## Adding the library to an existing app

**6.** In Android Studio with your app open, from the File menu, select New and New Module.

**7.** Select "Android Library" from the left pane.  Name the module QueueFairAdapter, and the package name must be "com.qf.adapter".  Gradle will sync when you hit Finish; wait for that to finish.

**8.** You will see QueueFairAdapter appear in the package explorer on the left hand side of Studio.

**9.** In File Explorer / Finder (not Android Studio), Copy-and-paste QueueFairAdapter/src from this distribution into the QueueFairAdapter folder that has been created by Studio, overwriting any files therein.

**10.** OPTIONAL: If you are using an old version of Studio, you might need to enable AppCompat.  For newer versions it's probably safe to skip this step - you can come back to it if you get AppCompat compile errors at the end.  Your project will now have three build.gradle files.  Find the one for the QueueFairAdapter Module.  If there is no "dependencies" section at the end of this file, or if there is no "appcompat" implementation line, add the following stanza at the end:

	dependencies {
    		implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
	}
 
If your build.gradle has the .kts extension, then itâ€™s brackets and double quotes instead of single quotes around the string, but in that case your Studio is probably new enough to skip this step anyway.

**11.** Now press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S to open the Project Structure dialog.  Select Dependencies, then app from the Modules pane, and then "+" in the Declared Dependencies section, and "Module Dependency" (not Library).

**12.** Check the QueueFairAdapter box and hit OK.  Gradle will sync, and your app is now buildable.

## Running the Adapter

**13.** In your app's Android Manifest, you must add the following activity definition to the <application> stanza:

	<activity
            android:name="com.qf.adapter.android.QueueFairActivity"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
	</activity>

The android:theme attribute is optional, and causes the Queue Pages to be shown without a title bar.

**14.** Example code with instructions on how to use the QueueFairClient in your own code is contained in QueueFairDemo's MainActivity.java, in the continueClicked() method at the end.  Typically you will construct it with a QueueFairClientListener instance and then call queueFairClient.go();

**15.** In the line that constucts the QueueFairClient, change the accountSystemName to the System Name for your account from the Queue-Fair Portal's Account -> Your Account page.  Also change the queueSystemName to the System Name for the queue you want to use in this app or for your protected activity/operation, visible in the Queue-Fair Portal on the Queue Settings page.  If you create a custom Variant for display in your app, also pass in the variant name here.

**16.** Build and run your app.

That's it you're done!

### To test the Android Adapter
We RECOMMEND you run both the tests in this section after any update to your app that could affect the operation of your Queue-Fair Adapter, including changes you make in the Portal, updates to packages used by your app, SDK updates, Studio updates or operating system updates.  If you have a release test matrix, add both these quick tests to it.  Use a queue that is not in use on other pages/apps, or create a new queue for testing.

#### Testing SafeGuard
Make sure your code uses the correct queue System Name, and that the Queue is set to SafeGuard.

Open the app and hit Continue.  A Toast will appear to indicate that you have been passed by SafeGuard, without seeing a Queue Page, and the protected activity will launch.

Use the back button on your phone/emulator.  Tap Continue again.  The Toast will indicate that you have been Repassed, because the Passed Lifetime for your queue has not expired, and the protected activity will launch again.


#### Testing Queue
Go back to the Portal and put the queue in Demo mode on the Queue Settings page.  Hit Make Live.  

In the App tap Reset Adapter to delete your Passed status, stored by the app.

Tap Continue.
 - Verify that you are now sent to queue.
 - When you come back to the page from the queue, verify that a Toast appears containing the word "Passed", and that the protected activity launches.
 - Use the back button and hit Continue again.  Verify that you are shown as "Repassed", without seeing a Queue Page a second time.

If you wish to fully clear your Passed status, then if you have been shown a Queue Page, you must tap both Reset Adapter and Reset Queue-Fair buttons.  These buttons are present in the QueueFairDemo app to help you test - you would not normally show them in a production app.


### Advanced Topics

Activation Rules and Variant Rules from the portal are not germane to this use case and are ignored.  Instead, specify the queue you wish to use and (optionally) the variant you want to display in the construction call to QueueFairClient.

Any Target settings for your queue are also not germane to this use case and are also ignored - rather you set the target within your app in the QueueFairClientListener implementation that you supply to QueueFairClient.  Any Queue Pages shown within your app will not go on to request a target page from any site.

QueueFairClient objects are not reusable - you should create a new one every time your app is about to start the protected activity/operation.

If it is determined that a Queue, Hold, PreSale or PostSale page should be shown, the Queue-Fair Adapter will by default launch an activity with a whole-screen WebView in which to run any Queue Pages.

To customise the display for your app, the easiest way is to can create a variant of your queue for use within your app in the Queue-Fair Portal, and tell your app to use it by passing its name as the variant parameter to the QueueFairClient constructor.  This means that your app users can participate in the same queue as your website visitors, but have a custom display for your app.

For finer display control, you may wish to subclass QueueFairActivity, which will allow you to use your own custom layouts, including Android UI components.  For example, you may wish to use Android UI components for the text of the queue page, with just the progress bar within a WebView.  To do this, you can set QueueFairClient.defaultActivityClass to your new subclass.

If you need to use a variety of different QueueFairActivity subclasses for different queues within your app, then set a QueueFairClient instance's activityClass field to YourClass.class after the QueueFairClient has been constructed but before QueueFairClient.go() is called.

Logging to Logcat is disabled by default, but you can enable it with QueueFairConfig.debug = true - but please make sure it is disabled for release versions of your app.

Unlike our Server-Side Adapters, this Adapter does not download your queue settings file from the Portal.  Activation Rules are not relevant for our App adapters so need not be downloaded, and the Passed Lifetime is instead obtained direct from our Queue Servers at the moment a Passed Cookie is to be created.

You can override the Passed Lifetime from the Queue Servers with a parameter in code if you wish.

Unlike our Server-Side Adapters, The Android adapter always works in SAFE_MODE - SIMPLE_MODE is not suitable for this use case.

## Push Notifications
If a user abandons the queue by closing the app or navigating away from it, their place is saved, and they will proceed through the queue when they re-open the app as if they had left it open all along.  If the front of the queue has not yet reached them, they will be closer to it.  If the front of the queue has passed them, they will be passed straight away, depending on the Front of Queue settings that you use for your queue in the Queue-Fair Portal.
	
You may wish to send a Push Notification to a user who has abandoned telling them that they are at the front of the queue.  Your app must have Notification permissions in order to be able to show push notifications - see https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging and https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/first-message for a tutorial on Push Notifications in Android if you are setting up Push Notifications for the first time.

Once you have a Push Notification system and server up and running, the procedure is as follows:
	
**1.** In the onJoin() method of your QueueFairClientListener implementation, store the received Request Number, which is the user's position in the queue.  The Adapter will also automatically store it for you, and you can get the most recently assigned Request Number at any time by calling `QueueFairAndroidService.getPreference(MainActivity.this, "mostRecentRequestNumber");` in your code.  Don't ask your Push Notification server to schedule a notification in onJoin() - just remember the request number in case you need it later.
	
**2.** You only want to send Push Notifications to people who have abandoned.  So, in the onAbandon() method of your QueueFairClientListener implementation, tell your Push Notification server that this user wants a notification when they reach the front of the queue.  Include the request number from onJoin() in that message to your Push Notification server.  Note that on some versions of Android, the onAbandon() method may be called multiple times due to a single act of abandonment - but you should only ask your Push Notification to send a notification once. Similarly, if the wait is long, users may abandon the queue and return to it several times.  You should therefore set a preference to persistently remember that the app has asked for a notification from your Push Notification server here, and not ask again if it is already set.

**3.** Your Push Notification server will need store an association between the Request Number and the unique ID that it uses to send notifications to specific users.  It is recommended that associations stored for more than 24 hours are deleted.  Your Push Notifiation server will also need to consult the Queue-Fair Queue Status API every minute or so to find out what the current Serving number is.  If the current Serving number is greater than or equal to the Request number for a particular user, it is time to send that user the Push Notification.  The Status API may also report that the queue has emptied.  If that happens, don't send notifications to all the users that have requested them at the same time, as if they all come back at the same time, it may be necessary to queue them again - but you can prevent that from happening by sending the notifications no faster than the SafeGuard Rate for your queue when the queue is empty.
	
**4.** If the user returns to the app and opens the Queue again before their turn has been called, or after their turn has been called but before they have received a Push Notification from your Push Notification server, you should tell your Push Notification server not to send the notification after all.  So, in both the onPass() and onShow() methods of your QueueFairClientListener implementation, check to see if the preference you set in Step 2 has been set, and if it has, tell your Push Notification server that a notification is no longer required, and then unset the preference.
	
**5.** The user might abandon and rejoin the queue multiple times if the wait is long.  If they abandon again, go back to Step 2.
